<h2>Description<a class="headerlink" href="#description" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a very exciting widget which is useful for teaching induction of
classification trees and also in practice, where a data miner and an area
expert can use it to manually construct a classification tree helped by the
entire Orange&#8217;s widgetry.</p>
<p>The widget is based on <a class="reference internal" href="classificationtreeviewer.html#classification-tree-viewer"><em>Classification Tree Viewer</em></a>. It is mostly the
same (so you are encouraged to read the related documentation), except for
the different input/output signals and the addition of a few buttons.</p>
<img alt="Interactive Tree Builder widget" src="../../../_images/InteractiveTreeBuilder.png" />
<p>Button <tt class="xref py py-obj docutils literal"><span class="pre">Split</span></tt> splits the selected tree node according to the criterion
above the button. For instance, if we pressed Split in the above widget,
the animals that don&#8217;t give milk and have no feathers (the pictures shows
a tree for the zoo data set) would be split according to whether they are
<em>aquatic</em> or not. In case of continuous attributes, a cut off point
needs to be specified as well.</p>
<p>If Split is used on a node which is not a leaf, the criterion at that node
is replaced. If we, for instance, selected the <tt class="xref py py-obj docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;root&gt;</span></tt> node and pushed
<tt class="xref py py-obj docutils literal"><span class="pre">Split</span></tt>, the criterion <em>milk</em> would be replaced with <em>aquatic</em>
and the nodes below (<em>feathers</em>) are removed.</p>
<p>Button <tt class="xref py py-obj docutils literal"><span class="pre">Cut</span></tt> cuts the tree at the selected node. If we pushed Cut
in the situation in the picture, nothing would happen since the selected
node (<tt class="xref py py-obj docutils literal"><span class="pre">feathers=0</span></tt>) is already a leaf. If we selected <tt class="xref py py-obj docutils literal"><span class="pre">&lt;root&gt;</span></tt>
and pushed Cut, the entire tree would be cut off.</p>
<p>Cut is especially useful in combination with <tt class="xref py py-obj docutils literal"><span class="pre">Build</span></tt> which builds
a subtree at the current node. So, if we push Build in the situation
depicted above, a subtree would be built for the milkless featherless
animals, leaving the rest of the tree (that is, the existing two nodes)
intact. If Build is pressed at a node which is not leaf, the entire subtree
at that node is replaced with an automatically induced tree.</p>
<p>Build uses some reasonable default parameters for tree learning (information
gain ratio is used for attribute selection with a minimum of 2 examples per
leaf, which gives an algorithm equivalent to Quinlan&#8217;s C4.5). To gain more
control on the tree construction arguments, use a <a class="reference internal" href="classificationtree.html#classification-tree"><em>Classification Tree Learner</em></a>
widget or <a class="reference internal" href="c45.html#c4-5"><em>C4.5 Learner</em></a> widget, set its parameters and connect it to the
input of Interactive Tree Builder. The set parameters will the be used for
the tree induction. (If you use C4.5, the original Quinlan&#8217;s algorithm,
don&#8217;t forget to check <tt class="xref py py-obj docutils literal"><span class="pre">Convert</span> <span class="pre">to</span> <span class="pre">orange</span> <span class="pre">tree</span> <span class="pre">structure</span></tt>.)</p>
<p>The widget has several outputs. <tt class="xref py py-obj docutils literal"><span class="pre">Examples</span></tt> gives, as in
<a class="reference internal" href="classificationtreeviewer.html#classification-tree-viewer"><em>Classification Tree Viewer</em></a> the list of examples from the selected node.
This output can be used to observe the statistical properties or
visualizations of various attributes for a specific node, based on which
we should decide whether we should split the examples and how.</p>
<p>Signal <tt class="xref py py-obj docutils literal"><span class="pre">Classification</span> <span class="pre">Tree</span></tt> can be attached to another tree viewer.
Using a <a class="reference internal" href="classificationtreeviewer.html#classification-tree-viewer"><em>Classification Tree Viewer</em></a> is not really useful as it will
show the same picture as Interactive Tree Builder. We can however connect
the more colorful <a class="reference internal" href="classificationtreegraph.html#classification-tree-graph"><em>Classification Tree Graph</em></a>.</p>
<p>The last output is <tt class="xref py py-obj docutils literal"><span class="pre">Tree</span> <span class="pre">Learner</span></tt>. This is a tree learner which always
gives the same tree - the one we constructed in this widget. This can be used
to assess the tree&#8217;s quality with the <a class="reference internal" href="../evaluate/testlearners.html#test-learners"><em>Test Learners</em></a> widget. This
requires some caution, though: you should not test the tree on the same
data you used to induce it. See the Examples section below for the correct
procedure.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="examples">
<h2>Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The first snapshot shows the typical &#8220;environment&#8221; of the Interactive
Tree Builder.</p>
<img alt="A schema with Interactive Tree Builder" src="../../../_images/InteractiveTreeBuilder-SchemaInduction.png" />
<p>The learning examples may come from a file. We also use a
<a class="reference internal" href="classificationtree.html#classification-tree"><em>Classification Tree Learner</em></a> widget to able to set the tree induction parameters
for the parts of the tree we want to induce automatically.</p>
<p>On the right hand side, we have the <a class="reference internal" href="../data/rank.html#rank"><em>Rank</em></a> widget which assesses the
quality of attributes through measures like information gain, gini index
and others. Emulating the induction algorithm by selecting the attributes
having the highest value for one of these measures should give the same
results as using Classification Tree widget instead of the Interactive
Builder. However, in manual construction we can (and should) also rely on
the visualization widgets. One-dimensional visualizations like
<a class="reference internal" href="../visualize/distributions.html#distributions"><em>Distributions</em></a> give us an impression about the properties of a single
attribute, while two- and more dimensional visualizations like
<a class="reference internal" href="../visualize/scatterplot.html#scatter-plot"><em>Scatter Plot</em></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="../visualize/linearprojection.html#linear-projection"><em>Linear Projection</em></a> will give us a kind of
lookahead by telling us about the useful combinations of attributes. We
have also deployed the <a class="reference internal" href="../data/datatable.html#data-table"><em>Data Table</em></a> widget since seeing particular
examples in a tree node may also sometimes help the expert.</p>
<p>Finally, we use the <a class="reference internal" href="classificationtreegraph.html#classification-tree-graph"><em>Classification Tree Graph</em></a> to present the resulting
tree in a fancy looking picture.</p>
<p>As the widget name suggests, the tree construction should be interactive,
making the best use of the available Orange&#8217;s visualization techniques
and help of the area expert. At the beginning the widget presents a tree
containing only the root. One way to proceed is to immediately click
Build and then study the resulting tree. Data examples for various nodes
can be presented and visualized to decide which parts of the tree make sense,
which don&#8217;t and should better be reconstructed manually, and which subtrees
should be cut off. The other way is to start constructing the tree
manually, adding the nodes according to the expert&#8217;s knowledge and
occasionally use Build button to let Orange make a suggestion.</p>
<p>Although expert&#8217;s help will usually prevent overfitting the data,
special care still needs to be taken when we are interested in knowing
the performance of the induced tree. Since the widely used cross-validation
is for obvious reasons inapplicable when the model is constructed
manually, we should split the data into training and testing set prior
to building the tree.</p>
<img alt="A schema with Interactive Tree Builder" src="../../../_images/InteractiveTreeBuilder-SchemaSampling.png" />
<p>We have used the <a class="reference internal" href="../data/datasampler.html#data-sampler"><em>Data Sampler</em></a> widget for splitting the data; in most
cases we recommend using stratified random sampling with a sample size
of 70% for training. These examples (denoted as &#8220;Examples&#8221; in the snapshot)
are fed to the Interactive Tree Builder where we employ the Orange&#8217;s armory
to construct the tree as described above.</p>
<p>The tricky part is connecting the <a class="reference internal" href="../evaluate/testlearners.html#test-learners"><em>Test Learners</em></a>: Data Sampler&#8217;s
Examples should be used as Test Learners&#8217; Data, and Data Sampler&#8217;s
Remaining Examples are the Test Learners&#8217; Separate Test Data.</p>
<img alt="Connecting Data Sampler to Test Learners when using Interactive Tree Builder" src="../../../_images/InteractiveTreeBuilder-SchemaSampling-Wiring.png" />
<p>In Test Learners, don&#8217;t forget to set the Sampling type to
<tt class="xref py py-obj docutils literal"><span class="pre">Test</span> <span class="pre">on</span> <span class="pre">test</span> <span class="pre">data</span></tt>. Interactive Tree Builder should then give its
Tree Learner to Test Learners. To compare the manually constructed tree
with, say, an automatically constructed one and with a Naive Bayesian
classifier, we can include these two in the schema.</p>
<p>Test Learners will now feed the training data (70% sample it gets from
Data Sampler) to all three learning algorithms. While Naive Bayes and
Classification Tree will actually learn, Interactive Tree Builder will
ignore the training examples and return the manually built tree.
All three models will then be tested on the remaining 30% examples.</p>
